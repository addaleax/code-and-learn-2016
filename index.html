Your first pull request to Node.js core

---

# Lifecycle of a PR, part I

Before you open a pull request:

- Get the necessary tools if you don’t already have
- Do the changes you want to make
- Build node and make sure all tests still pass
- Commit the changes

---

# Lifecycle of a PR, part II

After you open a pull request:

- You will probably receive comments from reviewers
  - Address them by adding new commits or amending existing ones
- There is no automated CI, it will be kicked off manually by a collaborator
  - This may take a bit of time, there are only so many machines available
  - Infrastructure hiccups are not uncommon but most CI runs are mostly green
    these days
- At least one Node.js core collaborator has to sign off on the pull request,
  by commenting “LGTM” and/or using Github’s review feature
- There’s a minimum waiting period of 48/72 hours for non-trivial changes
- Just in case: If there is no movement on a PR for a few days, feel free to
  bump it

---

# Setup

- You need: A Github account, Git, Python, a compiler
- Fork `nodejs/node`
- Clone your fork

---

# General structure:

- `deps/` — Dependencies (V8, libuv, zlib, etc.)
- `doc/api/` – The API documentation (aka https://nodejs.org/api/)
- `lib/` – JS source files (everything that can be `require()`d)
- `src/` – C++ source files
- `test/parallel/` – (Almost all) Tests!

---

# Guides for contributing

- `CONTRIBUTING.md` – General contributing guide
  - Explains how a commit message should look like
- `doc/guides/writing_tests.md` – Especially helpful when writing new tests!
- `test/README.md` – Explains the `common` API used in our tests

---

# Wait for cloning to finish

---

# Compiling

```console
$ ./configure
$ make -j8 # Use -jN if your machine has N cores
$ ./node
> process.version
'v8.0.0-pre'
```

(Windows: `vcbuild nosign`)

---

# Building the docs

```console
$ make doc-only # or
$ make doc
```

→ Output in `out/doc/api`

---

# Testing your changes

```console
$ make -j8 test
```

(Windows: `vcbuild test`)
